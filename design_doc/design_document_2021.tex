\section{Preface}
Einstein said (or someone else, i'm too lazy to check), that many people die with music still left inside them.

The Aztoria Syndrome is my music. 
I don't intend to die before playing this music to the world and people around me. 
It is the culmination of 7 years of ideation, excessive doodling, star gazing, and mellow rumination over many hours of the days, waking and asleep.

I was a different person when I first began this process, and the themes for the story have changed countless times - perhaps too sentimental at the start, and now more practical and tangible.
The one constant is that the story is dedicated to humans, whom I love. 
And also my mum. 
Only recently (past 2 years) have the themes settled into a stable configuration, and I doubt it will change too drastically from now till the end of the project.

I will now tell this story.

\section{Skeleton}
	\subsection{Theme Statement}
	History is a process of evolution, not precession.
	The beauty of humankind.
	\subsection{One-Sentence Summary}
	A practical and curious member of the Aztorian bureaucracy decides to solve the mystery of disappearing citizens and appearance of alien-looking organisms at night; he finds himself among one of history's greatest conspiracies, and a city on the cusp of a grand revolution.
	\subsection{Apparent Story Questions}
	What is wrong with the city? $\rightarrow$ 
	What is the Aztoria Syndrome? $\rightarrow$  
	What is the history of the city, and humankind? $\rightarrow$ 
	Will, and how, will humans triumph?
\newpage






\section{Style}
	\subsection{Artstyle}
	Character designs will resemble Tintin. Simple, but hopefully effective.
	Environmental shots will showcase a modern but non-generic city scape.
	\subsection{Storytelling}
	Episodic structure, each episode tells one mystery. 
	More classic, more subdued style.
\newpage





\section{Setting}
	\subsection{Earth}
	Northern hemisphere is empty - wiped out by an old war.
	Colossal megastructures still remain as ruins.
	Abandoned spaceports and intercontinental railway networks.
	Only remaining continent with humans is Oceania.
	\subsection{Aztoria}
	Megacity situated on the eastern quarter of the Oceania continent. It is the final city on earth.
		\subsubsection{Material Situation}
		Post scarcity. Production of all goods are automated. 
		The city has some ancient structures with unknown purpose.
		There is an advanced train line called the Aztorian Train Line, with a CIty Loop near the center, where Aztoria began. 
		\subsubsection{Social Structure}
		The Aztorian government, the Aztorian University, and the Civil Protection Institute, make up the 3 pillars of Aztoria - the Aztorian bureaucracy.
		
		The Government consists of nothing but a group of human computers, who perform computations with the equations of SED that the Institute provides.
		
		The University conducts research permitted by the Aztorian Government.
		
		The Institute acts as the ``arms" of the city - its police, ambulance, and fire brigade combined.
		It also has a central board of directors who actively research SED separate from the University.
		Among them, the First Director is the highest authority.
		
		People can still pick jobs, but their lives no longer depend on it.
		They do it to pass their time. 
		Aloh, for example, asked to take care of a communal space that primarily serves drinks and desserts.
		Scientists are one main area of work, now that mundane services are all automated.
		Above them, a job in the bureaucracy has the highest form of prestige, since they are viewed as guardians of civilisation itself.
		
		Education is valued highly just by mandate of the Institute. 
		To promote sense of social belonging, a class of students stay together until University.

\section{Mechanics}
	
	\subsection{Consciousness}
	Information flow across spacetime.
	Flow across space, over time, allows information to pass from one part of the bran to another, and formation of memory.
	It is poetically called the ``currents of spacetime" by Professor Lambda, and sometimes refered to as ``currents of time", or simply ``currents".
	This is facilitated by an electric structure that is the brain.
	It is subject to influence by magnetic fields.
		\subsubsection{Currents}
		Near the end of the story, Emma realises that her memories are carried by warm currents of time, from the future. 
		The newon awakening has caused humans to evolve to become proto-telepathic, using nothing more but the currents of time.
	\newpage
	
	\subsection{Plague}
		\subsubsection{Symptoms}
		Extreme sleepiness, fatigue, dread, depression.
		Bizarre reactions to surroundings.
		Bizarre movements and speech, almost alien.
		Altered state of consciousness.
		\subsubsection{True Mechanics of the Plague}
		It is a gradual separation of the consciousness with the body. 
		In the end stage, the consciousness - collection of currents of spacetime - forms a stable structure separate from the brain.
		This structure can take arbitrary shape, but most attempt to stay in shape of a human, but comically fails, and appear grotesque and alien.
		The structure is the black organism that seeps out of the patients head during their sleep - their mind has literally left their body. It will be refered to as a ``newon".
		It is so stable that no information can leave the boundaries of the structure - that's why it appears black.
		Death occurs only because the structure has no way to recombine with the body, and the body is left to rot while the consciousness wanders till the end of time, deforming further.
		
		Upon destruction, the currents of time disperse into the universe.
		\subsubsection{Transmission}
		During sleep, black organisms seep out of the patient's head and wander about, infecting anyone they come into contact with.
		This is because the organisms have affinity to one another, and draw each other out (probably due to the electromagnetic origins of consciousness).
		\subsubsection{Destruction of Transmission}
		A powerful and concentrated magnetic field differential will disrupt the organisms.
		If by the time of destruction, the physical body was still alive, the currents will return to the body.
		Otherwise, they disperse into the surrounding.
		\subsubsection{Immunity}
		If an individual is unable to sleep, they are unable to let their consciousness escape their body, thus immune to death by this plague.
		\subsubsection{Treatment}
		Terminal illness. 
		Death is inevitable.
		Though, preventative measures can be taken such that if someone is hyper alert and insomniac, the initial transmission/contact does no effect to pull the person's consciousness out.
		\newpage
		
	\subsection{The Grand Synthesis}
	Plan of the Institute to integrate all of humankind's consciousness into a single superstructure.
		\subsubsection{Chain Reaction}
		In general it is possible to merge consciousness in the nonstandard form - the newon form. 
		One on one, it requires physical contact, but if there is a large enough concentration, people in the surrounding can spontaneously lose their consciousness to it.
		\subsubsection{Great Attractor}
		To create a species wide chain reaction, they need a cite of nucleation - a great attractor - a newon that is so perfect that it retains the person's likeliness perfectly. It is now capable of transmitting info in and out of its boundary, gaining colour once more.
		
		The people who volunteer to become an attractor, have to abandon their bodies and live as an attractor. Unless the Institute intends to begin the Synthesis of mankind right away, these attractors must be put in perfect solitude. 
		
		The only two attractors created in history escaped, and the Institute put the project on hold. 
		The first one escaped to district 0, and accidentally caused a small scale synthesis event, merging all residents of that district. 
		From then on, she \textit{was} the district.
		The second one was Nerezza, Lucca's mother. She did not straight up disappear, but promised the Institute to fulfill their plans in the future, so that they will not create any more attractors. 
		Nerezza wanders the city in the outer regions, never stopping long in a single place in fear of the newons attracting towards her and starting the synthesis event. 
		Her real body is severly mentally impaired. 
		Lucca grows tired of caring for her and sends her to a nursing home, which he intensely regrets.
		\subsubsection{Superstructure}
		The object that is the amalgamation of all human consciousness. Upon destruction, Nerezza's existence is scattered across spacetime. That's why brief images of her can be seen at all points in the story, in weird places.
		\newpage
	
	\subsection{Electromagnetism}
	Given a loop of wire, no matter the scale, if an electric current runs through the wires, a magnetic field will be generated in a donut-like shape engulfing the loop. 
	The shape of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is a straight line shooting in both direction to the infinite, along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the loop.
	
	\subsection{Weapon of the Order - Aztoria}
	``When in trouble, get on the A Train", sing the older people. 
	It was a clue passed down the generations by the people who created this city. 
	
	The City Loop is actually a colossal loop of wires hidden in the concrete. 
	Upon activating a hidden power source, the loop generates enough magnetic field to destroy a superstructure the size of the entire human race. 
	If this is done when the bodies have yet to decay, the currents will return to the bodies. The sight looks like a massive rain from the sky.
	
	Instructions to use the weapon are inscribed as horizontal striped markings of uneven lengths, on the side shields of the train line. 
	The messages hidden in these markings will only be apparent when the train starts moving - the stripes appear like flashes through the window, long and short. 
	It is Morse Code.
	
	The weapon is simply named ``Aztoria".
	\newpage
	
	\subsection{Societal Evolution Dynamics}
	Mathematical, formalised system describing theorems of evolution of human societies. 
	Originally created in the warring era when scholars across the earth were tasked by the Earth Federation with finding a way to predict and prevent wars.
	
	Includes characteristics of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, linear algebra.
	Main high level process is constructing a Jacobian detailing the partial derivatives of a set of inputs and outputs for a certain human system. 
	Solving the tensor equation gives the required changes in configuration space in order to achieve desired outcomes in the real world space.
	
	\subsubsection{Precession}
	One meta-theorem of history birthed from following theorems: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Humans alter their surrounding conditions.
		\item Surrounding conditions alter humans.
		\item A capable society alters their surroudings favourably.
		\item A favourable surrounding produces a complacent society.
		\item A complacent society alters their surroundings negatively.
		\item A negative surrounding produces humans capable of withstanding it.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	On the largest time scales, this forms an inconceivable cycle, and results in a periodic timeline of golden and dark ages. 
	History repeats.
	
	\subsubsection{Evolution}
	The real meta-theorem of history.
	
	History is a process of evolution, birthed from the continual resolution of contradictions. 
	Each set of contradictions defines an epoch.
	The transition between epochs are where history happens.
	A new standard is established, and human society reaches ever higher heights. History does not repeat.
	
	The main contradiction of the epoch before the birth of Aztoria was an economic one, the resolution of which was a world-wide war.
	Out of this end to the epoch birthed 3 things:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Unification of humankind, where they found refuge in Oceania. The end of Imperialism and Nationalism.
		\item The automated Factory Array - the disappearance of scarcity and currency.
		\item The study of Societal Evolution Dynamics.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Other than that, it has left Aztorians the primary contradiction of today: the stability offered by a bureaucracy versus the desire for progress by the people.
	
	Eventually, the bureaucracy loses its standing. 
	What used to be a guardian of the new civilisation has long ceased to being a progressive force. 
	It will eventually lose to the people and disappear from history. 
	Thanks to the SED they developed, the people now have what they need to lead a future of never ending progress.
	The dreams of humankind are crying out.
	
	However, should the bureeaucracy continue to resist, the people will fall, and the bureaucracy along with them. 
	A common ruin to the contending parties.
	Older forms of society will return. 
	Life will return to prehistoric violence, and all will be lost.
