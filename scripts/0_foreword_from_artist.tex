\title{Foreword from Artist}
\maketitle
This story is the culmination of 7 years of daydreaming, excessive doodling, star gazing, and mellow rumination over my surroundings and my knowledge.

Inspired by Isaac Asimov's Foundation, and conversations with mum.
The Aztoria Syndrome is a celebration of history and humanity.
