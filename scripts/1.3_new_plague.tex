%Lucca, at government.
%Bureaucrat: "What is it this time?"
%Lucca: "I come with a proposal."
%BUreaucrat: "Again? Alright let's hear it."
%Lucca: "Allow Aztorian scientists to pursue rocketry."
%Bureaucrat: "...Do you think we're a joke?"
%Lucca: "No I'm serious. Here, I even have the SED equations prepared."
%Bureaucrat: "You just did some basic summaries. There is like zero working out. This is not enough. You have to first ask one of our specially trained computers to perform computations, which may take anywhere from 1 month up to a year. THEN you bring that result to me, and THEN I can pass it along to my management, and then HE will pass it along to the central board of directors, and theeeeeen you may have your proposal considered. Go away!"
