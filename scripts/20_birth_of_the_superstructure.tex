\title{Birth of the Superstructure}
\maketitle


Exterior, Aztoria. 
Nerezza lays down her suitcase. 

\ 

NEREZZA: "All the Newons I've been harvesting, it's time to come out!"

\ 

The suitcase opens, and all the contained Newons inside burst outward, climbing toward her.
They merge into her body and she grows.
Lucca is still devastated in his fetal position with eyes shut.

\ 

NEREZZA: "Won't even look at me?
Witness the birth of the Superstructure."

\ 

Lucca doesn't move. 
People in the surrounding all dissolve into Newons.
The entire city dissolves and flies towards Nerezza, who is standing at the centre of Aztoria. 

Interior, Institute.
Some people around her have dissolved already.
Emma looks out the window towards the City Loop, still with tears in eyes.

\ 

DIRECTOR ROBERT: "Looks like he failed."

EMMA, tired smile: "Yeah."

\ 

The two dissolve.

\ 

\ 

Exterior, Aztoria.
It is a colossal, grotesque object.
The product of the final Synthesis event.
Contained within is the sum of human consciousness.

\ 

\ 

Interior of the synthesis. 
Lucca opens his eyes finally. 



%Fever Dream
