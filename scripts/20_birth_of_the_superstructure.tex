\title{Birth of the Superstructure}
\maketitle


Exterior, Aztoria. 
Nerezza lays down her suitcase. 

\ 

NEREZZA: "All the Newons I've been harvesting, it's time to come out!"

\ 

The suitcase opens, and all the contained Newons inside burst outward, climbing toward her.
They merge into her body and she grows.
Lucca is still devastated in his fetal position with eyes shut.

\ 

NEREZZA: "Won't even look at me?
Witness the birth of the Superstructure."

\ 

Lucca doesn't move. 
People in the surrounding all dissolve into Newons.
The entire city dissolves and flies towards Nerezza, who is standing at the centre of Aztoria. 

Interior, Institute.
Some people around her have dissolved already.
Emma looks out the window towards the City Loop, still with tears in eyes.

\ 

DIRECTOR ROBERT: "Looks like he failed."

EMMA, tired smile: "Yeah."

\ 

The two dissolve.

\ 

\ 

Exterior, Aztoria.
It is a colossal, grotesque object.
The product of the final Synthesis event.
Contained within is the sum of human consciousness.

\ 

\ 

Fever dream segment as all consciousness fly towards one another.
Mr Tree hallucinates seeing his wife - the first attractor.
Professor Lambda sees Einstein.
Alex sees the launch of Sputnik.
Nerezza appears everywhere.
Aloh is the last to dissolve.

Interior of the synthesis. 
Lucca opens his eyes finally. 
Nerezza is singing.

LUCCA: "Mum? Is that you?"

They are in her bedroom, in front of her desk.
Lucca is young.
She is drawing. 

LUCCA: "What are you drawing?"

MUM: "I'm recording a dream."

We see her comics.

LUCCA: "What was your dream about?"

MUM: "It's a vision of happiness. 
A message from another time.
It is raining, and it is a joyous moment."

LUCCA: "So... these pictures are from another time?
When?"

Silence.

LUCCA: "Mum?"

Extreme close up of mum's eye.
She looks disturbing.
Revelation shot of her looking deformed, like a Newon.

LUCCA: "Mum!"

She stands up, menacingly towers over him and pushes him to the floor.
Lucca stands up as an adult, seeing her from outside a building.
He is at the shore. 
Concrete buildings are behind.
He looks backwards.
The land is full of Newons staring at him.
Through the Newon crowd, he sees Emma lie on the ground the distance. 

\ 

We change perspective to Emma.
