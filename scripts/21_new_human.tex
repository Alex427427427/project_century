LUCCA: "What can I do? 
We are all trapped in here. 
Soon, our bodies outisde will starve."

NEREZZA: "Lucca, you are not stuck in here. 
You are not even part of the synthesis.
You never were. 
Rise up and get going!
Unlike others, you are not even asleep right now!"

NEREZZA, cheeky wink: "You have insomnia, remember?"

LUCCA suddenly opens his eyes, finding himself lying on the ground of an empty Aztoria.
The superstructure looms in the distance at the centre of the City Loop.
