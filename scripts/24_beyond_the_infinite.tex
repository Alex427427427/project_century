\title{Beyond the Infinite}
\maketitle

Sunlight over Aztorian rubble.
Lucca stands alone now. 
He is at the shore.
He looks to his left, Nerezza's image appears once.
The image makes Lucca smile whole-heartedly with a tear escaping his eye.

\textbf{"Dearest son, the Future Civilisation Project is complete. 
the Aztoria Syndrome, is no more.}
\textbf{Welcome to 0000 N.C. - New Centuries."}

He walks through the city in a similar way he did in chapter 1.
Many people are sleeping in the streets. 

He reaches the underground shelter.
Sunlight shines in. 
Emma lies on the ground with eyes staring wide open, upwards.
The scene is reminiscent of Lucca's mum's artwork.

Lucca looks at Emma, who turns slightly towards him and stares back.
After a few suffocating moments, Emma smiles slightly.

The end.
