\title{Stars on the Ground are City Lights}
\maketitle

Sunlight over Aztorian rubble.
Lucca stands alone now. 
He is at the shore.
He looks to his left, Nerezza's image appears once.
The image makes Lucca smile whole-heartedly with a tear escaping his eye.

\textbf{"Dearest son, the Future Civilisation Project is complete. 
the Aztoria Syndrome, is no more.}
\textbf{Welcome to 0000 N.C. - New Centuries."}

He walks through the city in a similar way he did in chapter 1.
Many people are sleeping in the streets. 

He reaches the cryo chamber.
Sunlight shines in. 
Susan lies on the ground with eyes staring wide open, upwards.
The scene is reminiscent of Lucca's mum's artwork.

Lucca sees a vision of standing at the top of a building with Susan.
City lights shine brightly in the background.

Lucca looks at Susan, who turns slightly towards him and stares back.
After a few suffocating moments, she smiles just noticeably.

The end.
