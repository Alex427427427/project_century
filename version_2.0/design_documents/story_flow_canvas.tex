\section{Beneath the City Lights}

Lucca walks at the south-eastern shore of Oceania. Shots of the city skyline, with an eerie row of oddly uniform buildings with no windows or doors. 

Lucca takes a letter out of his pocket and reads it.

LETTER: "Luc, I discovered a secret about the world. 
Meet me tomorrow 6pm at the abandoned shoreline, near the City Loop. 
Pardon the strange way of communication. 
Don't text me about this. Marco"

Marco doesn't show up. Lucca starts considering the possibilities. Did I get the time wrong? Did Marco get caught up in something? Did Marco forget? (IN THAT ORDER.) ...Is Marco in danger?

Suddenly, an image of a woman in black appears briefly, and disappears. This startles Lucca.
