\section{Opening}

Lucca walks at the south-eastern shore of Oceania. Shots of the city skyline, with an eerie row of oddly uniform buildings with no windows or doors. 

Lucca takes a letter out of his pocket and reads it.

LETTER: "Luc, I discovered a secret about the world. 
Meet me tomorrow 6pm at the abandoned shoreline, near the City Loop. 
Pardon the strange way of communication. 
Don't text me about this. 
Marco"

Marco doesn't show up. Lucca starts considering the possibilities. Did I get the time wrong? Did Marco get caught up in something? Did Marco forget? (IN THAT ORDER.) ...Is Marco in danger?

Suddenly, an image of a woman in black appears briefly, and disappears. This startles Lucca. 






\section{Marco's journey}
Marco, lead engineer of the 13th branch of the Factory Array, friend of Lucca, husband of Susan. Openly criticises the bureaucracy. Hides important notes 

In Marco's readings, he came across the unsolved mystery of Dark Matter. He figures out a solution, that the undetectable mass is alien mass. This makes him excited, and wanting to have a space program.

He brings his theory to the Director of Future History.

After the meeting, he has a bad feeling. He writes a physical letter to be delivered to Lucca. 


\section{The Conspiracy}
A conspiracy to put humanity to sleep.

	\subsection{Origin and Purpose}
	It is 30 years prior to the story. The Director of Future History discovers that humanity is heading towards a dead end. Resource is running out in Oceania. The space program was cancelled, as decided by the Chronos program. Even out in space, the solution to Dark Matter and Fermi Paradox reveal that cosmic civilisations hide from one another in fear of war. Back on earth, revolutionary ideals are growing inside Oceania. Every path spells doom for the human race. There is no point in anything - so the Director must seize history into her own hands, and euthanise humanity for good. Thus began Project Hypnos. She will need help from a neuroscientist. She sits next to him during the 4th centennial celebration for the Unification of Humankind...
	\subsection{Funding}
	The project takes up one of the neuroscience labs, with heavy security.
	It uses material from the Factory Array. 
	
\section{Lucca and Susan}
Their journey.

They first meet at Marco's grave. 

Years later, Lucca finds Susan at a neuroscience institute, during his search of aliens.

Susan goes on leave. Lucca visits Susan's home to find her drawings. 

They follow Aloh secretively.

Lucca is worried they're not getting results. Susan points out his inability to enjoy the moment.

When they get home, they realise agents of the Oceanian government are inside. They wait until the people leave. Lucca wants to retrieve the notes, Susan pleads him to stop probing the government.

Lucca retrieves Marco's notes. One of them is for Susan, so he delivers it to her. In the note, Marco tells her that "love befits thee". 

Susan reports on her own findings about anomalies around the city.
They walk through the city at night. 
They enter a shelter and dance.
They read the Morse Code scribed onto the walls at the sides of the train tracks. 
They realise there is a revolution brewing.




\section{Anomalies}
Main mysteries that Lucca will have to solve.

0. Marco's death

1. Iron shortage in Oceania.

2. Coastal buildings with no windows nor doors

3. City Loop inscriptions

4. Dark Matter

5. Fermi Paradox

6. Newons

7. Nerezza's images

8. Government adversion to rocket science


\section{Secrets of the world}
These secrets hold the key to the future of humankind.

1. The solution to Dark Matter and the Fermi Paradox is alien civilisations. 
The Dark Matter halo around the galaxies surround the outer rims. 
This is the galactic habitable zone. 

2. An alien is in Oceania. 
Aloh, manager of a communal dining space, came from the stars. 
He is here to lead humanity to its future.

3. Humans have evolved. 
Leading a mostly carefree existence, the human brain has expanded its abilities, to be able to interpret Currents. 
As a result, humans are now proto-telepathic, and can anticipate into the future.

4. Consciousness is Currents of spacetime.

5. The Century Order long ago set in motion a plan to stop Project Chronos.
The City Loop is a giant loop of wires.
The coastal buildings are magnets.
The Department of Anomalies was founded to keep watch of the Government.
