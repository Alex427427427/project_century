[After Susan dies]


"All the things we can't see..." Susan said before she died.

And it was then something struck Lucca, and a thousand threads emerge before his eyes. The Factory AI discovering "a paradox"... Freda saying back in star gazer case "for 2 centuries, we have abandoned the pursuit of space. The dream, that one day humankind would find the universe within its grasp, died right here in the Ocean Union." Susan smiling, "Aloh's trumpet brings joy to humankind." Tom: "there was only one problem in physics from the 21st Century, that remain unsolved to this day." Marco writing down his note "I discovered a secret about the universe..." Marco writing down his poem "the secret hides within city darkness"...

NARRATION: "Susan's words made it all converge - a thousand different questions, melting into one answer. Even though Lucca could never speak directly to Marco ever again, he was convinced that he had, after two false realisations, finally happened upon the secret which Marco discovered. A secret that would have shattered Freda's plans had he vocalised it just a bit sooner. 

A secret that embraced all the stars above Ocean Union."
