Stars shine above a dark city.
A young man watches the sky through a pair of binoculars. 

NARRATION: "What is the perfect star gazing tool?
A telescope, naturally. 
Preferably one with an equatorial mount, that works with the geometry of earth's rotation, making tracking a star a breeze.
But most importantly of all, one that can filter out man-made light, so people like Eddie can enjoy the full view of the night sky at a more reasonable hour.
These days, professional astronomers simply tune in to the 28 space telescopes orbiting around earth, and star gazing from the ground has largely become a lost art."

Later, Eddie stands in front of a bed. 
A woman is sound asleep on the right side of the bed.
He climbs onto the left side. 
They lie faced away from each other. 

During the day, Eddie lays down the roof decking of a house under construction. 
He wears a grey tear-resistant suit with reflective orange stripes.
He drills in the last few nails for the wooden sheet he is currently laying onto the roof frame. 
(For now, readers may question why workers are still using relatively primitive technology for a future setting)
He dozes off. 
Just as he's about to fall, a coworker catches him. 

COWORKER: "EDDIE! WATCH OUT!"

The words wake Eddie. 
He sees his drill hit the ground below the roof he stands on.
He trembles a bit. 

At lunch time, Eddie and a few workers eat in a circle. 
The worker from earlier stands above him and points to him.

COWORKER: "Eddie, if this keeps happening, we'll have to get you fired for [italic]your[end italic] safety."

---- 

The sun sets, and Eddie rides his bicycle along a road, with the binoculars hung around his neck.
He parks by a small hill that faces a lake and lies on it, and begins remembering the past. 

It was a good while ago. 
Eddie was wearing casual clothes, lying on the same hill, sleeping. 
The binoculars were missing from his neck. 
A young woman (same as the woman at the beginning) walked up to him, holding his binoculars.

WOMAN: "Sir, you dropped this."

EDDIE: "Oh! Thanks!"

WOMAN: "You're welcome." 

Eddie fumbles the binoculars into his bag. 

WOMAN, not walking away: "Are you enjoying the lake?"

EDDIE: "Yeah yeah, it's a, it's a good view!"

WOMAN, smiling: "But your eyes were closed."

EDDIE: "Well uh, you can still, you know."

WOMAN, smiling more: "I don't know. You can still do what?"

EDDIE: "you can still feel the breeze, and uh, with eyes closed you can still imagine it. What the lake looks like."

WOMAN: "You were just sleepiing, weren't you."

They walked side by side as Eddie pushed his bike. 
A few stars shine with a hint in the still bright sky above them. 

EDDIE: "Do you notice how bright the city lights are at night? 
I have to star gaze at midnight, when the city lights go down. 
That's why I'm sleepy all day."

WOMAN: "So do you do this every night?"

EDDIE: "Almost every night."

WOMAN: "What for?"

EDDIE: "During the day, everything's making noises... It's annoying. 
When watching space, I feel like I can swim through the ocean of stars, leaving all worries behind on earth. 
You know?"

WOMAN: "Sounds fun. You can show me some time. I gotta go now, see ya!"

EDDIE: "See ya."

In the present, Eddie arrives home.

---- 

At night, Eddie watches the sky from his balcony. 

EDDIE: "Huh?"

Eddie sees something. 
He opens a cabinet, and from the neatly stacked pictures, he pulls one out. 
He holds it up to his left eye, and his right eye peers through his binoculars. 
Even though the stars are too close to distinguish by naked eye, he can at least compare the picture he took through the binoculars a few days ago, with what he is seeing today. 

A star is missing. 

Eddie takes another photo from the binoculars and compares the photos side by side. 
Unmistakably, at the same spot in the pictures, one of them has a bright dot, while the other does not. 
Eddie wakes his wife up. 

WIFE, rubbing her eyes: "What is it now? Let me sleep."

EDDIE: "Can you spot the difference between these photos?"

WIFE: "...Look the same to me."

EDDIE, pointing to the right picture: "A star is missing in this one."

WIFE, after a series of confused squinting, spotting it: "Oh. Weird."

EDDIE: "Very weird. The one on the left, I took it through the binoculars just a few days ago. The star was still there."

WIFE: "I'm going to sleep."

EDDIE: "Hey! Stars don't just disappear like that. This is something big."

WIFE: "Well, you can call the Department of what was it."

EDDIE: "Department of Anomalous Phenomena."

WIFE: "That's the one. Wait, do it tomorrow. Come to sleep already."

The wife turns her head, and Eddie is already gone, presumably calling in another room.

---- 

At DAP headquarters, an agent sleeps on a large octagonal desk at the centre of a large room. 
Monitors, buttons and dials fill the walls of this room, along with periodically blinking Lights. 
A single overhead lamp shines onto the central desk, leaving most of the room dark. 
The phone rings, waking the agent up. 

AGENT A: "Civillian call? Alright, put him through."

Brief pause.

AGENT A, slumping back in his chair to make himself comfortable: "Yes, yes, this is the Department of Anomalous Phenomena."

AGENT A, jolting forward: "What? A star disappeared?"

AGENT A, after pushing a button: "Can you give me the coordinates?"

AGENT A, grabbing paper and a pencil: "Yes. Yes." 

Director Alma and a few other agents arrive. 
Alma has white hair, a round face, and a pair of cunning/wise eyes. 
Different from other agents who wear the Ocean Union uniform, Alma wears a white trenchcoat with shoulder emblems - signature of a Director. 

ALMA: "What's the matter?"

AGENT A: "An amateur star-gazer. He says he saw a star completely disappear."

ALMA: "Lucca, check the observation deck."

LUCCA: "Ok."

AGENT B, leaning on the door frame: "Those amateurs are always seeing things."

LUCCA, handing over a photo: "...Nothing. There is no anomaly. The star is still there."

AGENT B: "Told ya."

LUCCA: "Maybe it was blocked by a passing asteroid?"

ALMA: "Let's check the space telescopes."

The agents each go to a telephone. 

AGENT A: "Hello? Department of Astronomy? Department of Anomalous Phenomena calling..."

AGENT B: "Uh, Cyan Hills Observatory? Department of Anomalous Phenomena speaking... ...so no asteroids or anything like that?"

LUCCA: "Hello? Ocean State University? This is the D.A.P.. Can I get Professor Thomas Burton?"

Afterwards, Alma stands at the central desk.

ALMA: "Same everywhere, huh."

AGENT A: "I guess that's it. A false alarm."

Lucca remains silent. He is thinking.
